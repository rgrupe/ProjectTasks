This is a doctest based regression suite for ..\projassigns.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.
To run: $python -m doctest -v ./test-data/projassigns_test.txt

Current program works: $ python projassigns.py projects.csv tasks.csv

>>>from projassigns import main
>>>main("projects.csv", "tasks.csv")
Your are running this program using the projects configuration file projects.csv and the task template file tasks.csv.

CURRENT ERROR: TypeError: main() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
